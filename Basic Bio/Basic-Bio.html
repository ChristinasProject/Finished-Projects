  <p class="dog">My dogs are my world. They love to cuddle, play and overall helps me with the darkest parts of my days when I have them. They love to go on walks, play fetch and play tug-o-war.</p>
  <p class="dog">My dogs are Rottweiler mixes and their names are Sombra and Kairi. I named them after my two favorite game characters. Sombra is Rottweiler/American Staffordshire Terrier/ChowChow/German Shepherd. Kairi is German Shepherd/Rottweiler mix. Sombra is turning 7 and Kairi is still a puppy at 11 months.</p>

  <p class="paragraph">I have earned a Google IT Certification and have a certification in Cyber Security from DeVry University and I am currently enrolled in school as a Computer Programmer and is thinking about switching my major as a Data Analyst so I can continue to use SQL in my daily life since that's the main coding language that I want to master.</p>
  <p class="paragraph">I want to plan on getting a Master's in Cyber Security when the time comes for me to do so. I would love to work on bug bounties as a side gig.</p></section>
